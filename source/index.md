# Virtual Reality Meeting Environment

## Abstract

Users are dissatisfied with existing VR Meeting platforms due to lack of
engagement, participation and unreliable cameras. We devise a VR
meeting platform emulating a physical meeting environment supporting
real-time rendering and communication, allowing participants to see the 
presenter and as each other. We target inexpensive VR equipment for 
inclusiveness.
