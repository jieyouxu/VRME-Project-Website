# Requirements

## Project Background

### A Design Problem

Our client pointed out that large organizations wish to be able to host
meetings, presentations and discussions which reflect the prescene of a
community or a team â€“ to better reflect an organization's culture.

Current remote meeting solutions, such as Skype [1], face the problems of:

- Lack of sense of participation as a team.
- Unreliable cameras.

## A Proposed Solution

To address the issues, the client proposed the direction of utilizing Virtual
Reality technology to emulate a meeting environment.

The emulated meeting environment would allow a meeting's participants (or team
members) to:

- create, join and leave a meeting session;
- see each other's avatars;
- be able to perform gestures; and
- watch the presentation be delivered in an emulated environment (such as an
  auditorium or lecture hall).
